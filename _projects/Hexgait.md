An exciting course on computational methods for developing motion algorithms. The course revolved around optimization methods and how different classes of motion solving problems can be framed into an optimization problem. Apart from the insightful and challening exercises, we also had a group course project on developing a gait controller for the hexapod, designing a macro obstacle avoidance planner and a finally a dance algorithm for a touch of fun.

What better way to showcase than to attach an explainer video.
