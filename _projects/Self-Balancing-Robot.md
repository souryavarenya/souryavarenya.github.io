However mainstream a 2 wheel self-balancing robot might be, it was certainly exciting as a sophomore, to put things together and get it to work. Being a course project, everyone was up to the nearly the same prototype but ours had to be something unique. After trying out some different combinations of wheels, motors and batteries, the prototype you see in the video above emerged.
