Thanks for stopping by!

I am Sourya, a full-stack roboticist interested in several verticals. I'm currently pursuing MSc at ETH ZÃ¼rich and have done my bachelors at IIT Madras. Having had hands-on experience with mechanical, electronics and software aspects of robotics, I thrive to get better at all of them and bring forth unique perspectives to solve multi-faceted problems.
