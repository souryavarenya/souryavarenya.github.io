I have graduated in June of 2018 and have begun my journey as a research assistant at the INDUS Lab of IIT Bombay. I am currently working on developing a Biped robot test bench for executing walking algorithms. Having had no experience in control theory, this has been a refreshing learning experience so far.

**Here's a list of research topics that fascinate me:**
* Exploring and exploiting _Natural Dynamics_ of robots for improving agility and energy efficiency
* Design of robots incorporating above principles
* Control theory and its practical aspects

Coming from a mechanical background, my mind is hardwired to think of mechanisms for generating a required motion. Having picked up some essentials of control theory, I am extremely excited of studying about the interplay of elegant control and optimized passive dynamics while building robots.

Thanks for stopping by!
